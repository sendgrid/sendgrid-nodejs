[![BuildStatus](https://travis-ci.org/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs)

Please see our announcement regarding [breaking changes](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/issues/290). Your support is appreciated!

**This library allows you to quickly and easily use the SendGrid Web API v3 via Node.js.**

Version 3.X.X+ of this library provides full support for all SendGrid [Web API v3](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html) endpoints, including the new [v3 /mail/send](https://sendgrid.com/blog/introducing-v3mailsend-sendgrids-new-mail-endpoint).

This library represents the beginning of a new path for SendGrid. We want this library to be community driven and SendGrid led. We need your help to realize this goal. To help make sure we are building the right things in the right order, we ask that you create [issues](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or simply upvote or comment on existing issues or pull requests.

Please browse the rest of this README for further detail.

We appreciate your continued support, thank you!

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js version 0.10, 0.12 or 4
- The SendGrid service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-nodejs)

## Setup Environment Variables

Update the development environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys), for example:

```bash
echo "export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'" > sendgrid.env
echo "sendgrid.env" >> .gitignore
source ./sendgrid.env
```

## Install Package

The following recommended installation requires [npm](https://npmjs.org/). If you are unfamiliar with npm, see the [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/). Npm comes installed with Node.js since node version 0.8.x therefore you likely already have it.

Add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "sendgrid": "^4.5.0"
  }
}
```

Install sendgrid-nodejs and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Alternative Installation

You can also install sendgrid locally with the following command:

```bash
npm install sendgrid
```

## Dependencies

- [Nodejs-HTTP-Client](https://github.com/sendgrid/nodejs-http-client)

# Quick Start

## Hello Email

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email with the [/mail/send Helper](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/tree/master/lib/helpers/mail) ([here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/examples/helpers/mail/example.js#L15) is a full example):

### With Mail Helper Class

```javascript
var helper = require('sendgrid').mail;
var from_email = new helper.Email('test@example.com');
var to_email = new helper.Email('test@example.com');
var subject = 'Hello World from the SendGrid Node.js Library!';
var content = new helper.Content('text/plain', 'Hello, Email!');
var mail = new helper.Mail(from_email, subject, to_email, content);

var sg = require('sendgrid')(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
var request = sg.emptyRequest({
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/v3/mail/send',
  body: mail.toJSON(),
});

sg.API(request, function(error, response) {
  console.log(response.statusCode);
  console.log(response.body);
  console.log(response.headers);
});
```

The `Mail` constructor creates a [personalization object](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/personalizations.html) for you. [Here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/examples/helpers/mail/example.js#L10) is an example of how to add to it.

### Without Mail Helper Class

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email without the /mail/send Helper ([here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/examples/mail/mail.js#L31) is a full example):

```javascript
var sg = require('sendgrid')(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
var request = sg.emptyRequest({
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/v3/mail/send',
  body: {
    personalizations: [
      {
        to: [
          {
            email: 'test@example.com',
          },
        ],
        subject: 'Hello World from the SendGrid Node.js Library!',
      },
    ],
    from: {
      email: 'test@example.com',
    },
    content: [
      {
        type: 'text/plain',
        value: 'Hello, Email!',
      },
    ],
  },
});

//With promise
sg.API(request)
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.statusCode);
    console.log(response.body);
    console.log(response.headers);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    //error is an instance of SendGridError
    //The full response is attached to error.response
    console.log(error.response.statusCode);
  });

//With callback
sg.API(request, function(error, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.log('Error response received');
  }
  console.log(response.statusCode);
  console.log(response.body);
  console.log(response.headers);
});
```

## General v3 Web API Usage

```javascript
var sg = require('sendgrid')(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY)

// GET Collection
var request = sg.emptyRequest({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/v3/api_keys'
});

//With promise
sg.API(request)
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.statusCode)
    console.log(response.body)
    console.log(response.headers)
  })
  .catch(error => {
    //error is an instance of SendGridError
    //The full response is attached to error.response
    console.log(error.response.statusCode);
  });

//With callback
sg.API(request, function(error, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.log('Error response received');
  }
  console.log(response.statusCode)
  console.log(response.body)
  console.log(response.headers)
})
```
