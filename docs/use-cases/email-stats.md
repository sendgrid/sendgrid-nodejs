# How to View Email Statistics

You can find documentation for how to view your email statistics via the UI [here](https://app.sendgrid.com/statistics) and via API [here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/HEAD/packages/client/USAGE.md#stats).

Alternatively, we can post events to a URL of your choice via our [Event Webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html) about events that occur as Twilio SendGrid processes your email.
