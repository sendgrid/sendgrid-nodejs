# How to View Email Statistics

You can find documentation for how to view your email statistics via the UI [here](https://app.sendgrid.com/statistics) and via API [here](../../packages/client/USAGE.md#stats).

Alternatively, we can post events to a URL of your choice via our [Event Webhook](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/event) about events that occur as Twilio SendGrid processes your email.
