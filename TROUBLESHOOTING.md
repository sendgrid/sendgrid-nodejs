## Migrating from v2 to v3

Please review [our guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/how_to_migrate_from_v2_to_v3_mail_send.html) on how to migrate from v2 to v3.

<a name="v2"></a>
## Continue Using v2

[Here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/tree/b57b32caa47608a15d23940a0dedc82a91e7b6aa) is the last working version with v2 support.

The following recommended installation requires [npm](https://npmjs.org/). If you are unfamiliar with npm, see the [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/). Npm comes installed with Node.js since node version 0.8.x therefore you likely already have it.

Add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "sendgrid": "1.9.2"
  }
}
```

Install sendgrid-nodejs and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Alternative Installation

You can also install sendgrid locally with the following command:

```bash
npm install sendgrid@1.9.2
```

Download:

Click the "Clone or download" green button in [GitHub](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/tree/b57b32caa47608a15d23940a0dedc82a91e7b6aa) and choose download.

## Testing v3 /mail/send Calls Directly

[Here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/curl_examples.html) are some cURL examples for common use cases.

<a name="error"></a>
## Error Messages

To read the error message returned by SendGrid's API, please see [this example](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/packages/mail/USE_CASES.md#success-failure-errors).

<a name="versions"></a>
## Versions

We follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme as described by [SemVer.org](http://semver.org). Therefore, we recommend that you always pin (or vendor) the particular version you are working with to your code and never auto-update to the latest version. Especially when there is a MAJOR point release, since that is guaranteed to be a breaking change. Changes are documented in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [releases](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/releases) section.

<a name="environment"></a>
## Environment Variables and Your SendGrid API Key

All of our examples assume you are using [environment variables](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs#setup-environment-variables) to hold your SendGrid API key.

If you choose to add your SendGrid API key directly (not recommended):

`process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY`

becomes

`'SENDGRID_API_KEY'`

In the first case SENDGRID_API_KEY is in reference to the name of the environment variable, while the second case references the actual SendGrid API Key.

<a name="package-manager"></a>
## Using the Package Manager

We upload this library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sendgrid) whenever we make a release. This allows you to use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) for easy installation.

In most cases we recommend you download the latest version of the library, but if you need a different version, please use:

`npm install @sendgrid/[package name]@X.X.X` 

Please check [here](https://www.npmjs.com/org/sendgrid) for a list of package names.

If you are using a `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@sendgrid/[package name]": "X.X.X"
  }
}
```

<a name="request-body"></a>
## Viewing the Request Body

When debugging or testing, it may be useful to examine the raw request body to compare against the [documented format](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/api_v3.html).

You can do this right before you call `sgMail.send(msg);` like so:

```javascript
const {
  classes: {
    Mail,
  },
} = require('@sendgrid/helpers');
const mail = Mail.create(data);
const body = mail.toJSON();
console.log(body);
```
