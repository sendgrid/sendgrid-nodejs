# SendGrid Community Code of Conduct

The SendGrid open source community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines, which help steer our interactions and strive to maintain a positive, thriving and growing community.

### Be Open
Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on pull requests, code reviews, approvals, issues or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of all members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate, and everyone can make a difference.

### Be Considerate
Members of the community are considerate of their peers, which include other contributors and users of SendGrid. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often the labor was completed with the intent of the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

### Be Respectful
Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the SendGrid community. We're respectful of the processes outlined in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.  Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.

## Additional Guidance

### Disclose Potential Conflicts of Interest
Community discussions often involve interested parties. We expect participants to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in and disclose those interests to other project members. When in doubt, over-disclose. Perceived conflicts of interest are important to address so that the community’s decisions are credible even when unpopular, difficult or favorable to the interests of one group over another.

### Interpretation
This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.  When in doubt, try to abide by [SendGrid’s cultural values](https://sendgrid.com/blog/employee-engagement-the-4h-way) defined by our “4H’s”: Happy, Hungry, Humble and Honest.  

### Enforcement
Most members of the SendGrid community always comply with this Code, not because of the existence of this Code, but because they have long experience participating in open source communities where the conduct described above is normal and expected. However, failure to observe this Code may be grounds for suspension, reporting the user for abuse or changing permissions for outside contributors.

## If you have concerns about someone’s conduct
**Initiate Direct Contact** - It is always appropriate to email a community member (if contact information is available), mention that you think their behavior was out of line, and (if necessary) point them to this Code.

**Discuss Publicly** - Discussing publicly is always acceptable. Note, though, that approaching the person directly may be better, as it tends to make them less defensive, and it respects the time of other community members, so you probably want to try direct contact first.

**Contact the Moderators** - You can reach the SendGrid moderators by emailing dx@SendGrid.com.

## Submission to SendGrid Repositories
Finally, just a reminder, changes to the SendGrid repositories will only be accepted upon completion of the [SendGrid Contributor Agreement](https://cla.sendgrid.com).
